In this react app I demonstrate my ability to fetch urls and utilise them to build a dynamic app, 
doing this I learned how to use ASYNC await and promises, I also learned how to manipulate state I ended up changing state a couple of times without using setstate as I had a problem with passing back and forth information from my flipLeft and flipRight functions.

As stated in my comment I need to learn how to use different styling depending on the size of the screen my app is being viewed from, unfortunately for now I settled on optimising the styling to fit all screens, this causes the text to look tiny when viewed form a computer screen though and I don't really like that. 

Regardless this app was meant to portray my grasp on AYNC and using APIs in my react apps. 

Thank you for viewing :)
